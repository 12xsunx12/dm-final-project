Overview:
Using a dataset of 14,000 points of different cyber security attacks, will categorize them on things like severity, malware family, commonality, technical difficulty, social engineering required, etc... to create a top 10 list of most common vulnerabilities, with a detailed reporting on how to defend against the top 3 found in our findings. With the goal being discovering what type of attacks are most common today, why, and how to properly defend against it as a business or independent consumer.
